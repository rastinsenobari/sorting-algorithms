# sorting-algorithms
This project is aimed at exploring sorting algorithms, understanding their time complexity, and providing an opportunity to exercise our programming skills. We will implement these algorithms in various programming languages.

## Selection Sort
- Complexity <br/>
∑(i in 0 to n) [ n-i ] = 1/2(n)(n-1) є θ(n^2)

## Bubble Sort
- Worst-case <br/>
O(n^2)
- Best-case <br/>
O(n)

## Insertion Sort
- Worst-case <br/>
O(n^2)
- Best-case <br/>
O(n)

## Merge Sort
- Complexity <br/>
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n  =>  T(n) є θ(n log n)

## Quick Sort
- Worst-case <br/>
O(n^2)
- Best-case <br/>
O(n log n)
